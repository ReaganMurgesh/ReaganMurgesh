## 👤 About Me

I’m an MCA student at Chanakya University who enjoys building software that actually works outside notebooks and demos.

My interests sit at the intersection of **data science, machine learning, and application development**. I like working end-to-end — from data and models to mobile apps, web platforms, and backend services — with a strong focus on clarity, scalability, and real-world usability.

Most days involve turning ideas (and coffee) into clean, maintainable code.
