## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **software oriented student** who loves to mix up theory and real world in case of **Data Sciences, Machine Learning and full stack dev**.  
My focus is on building **end-to-end systems** - mobile apps, web platforms, backend services and ml powered features.

In the various projects I've been working on, I've been working on projects in **healthcare analytics, educational tech, rehab monitoring, predictive ML models** and always strive for the clean architecture, scalability, and usability that actually matter.

I've also **published research** from the healthcare ML space and am active in **hackathons, talks, and tech events**.
